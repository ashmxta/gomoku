# Gomoku!

This was my first longer Python project I worked on in ESC180, the first programming course at EngSci UofT.

## Project Overview
Gomoku is a japanese board game that is essentially a version of tic-tac-toe where two players take turns aiming to align five of their stones in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). This implementation supports:
- A basic AI (no libraries) that uses a scoring heuristic to choose moves
- Detection of open, semi-open, and closed sequences
- Victory, draw, and ongoing game detection
## Features
- Board rendering in the terminal
- Game loop with alternating turns
- Move evaluation and scoring
- Win condition checking
